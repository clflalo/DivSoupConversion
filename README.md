## **Task to be done**

Refactor existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology is a common task for front-end and junior developers. For this homework assignment, I must refactor an existing site to make it more accessible and follow proper HTML Semantics.

# Finished Product

1. Changed the HTML to meet proper semantics criteria.

2. Removed unnecessary CSS class and element selectors that were doing the same things.

3. Changed title of website to match with the content.

4. Fixed "Nav Bar" not navigating to certain areas of the website on click.
